                    **P04_PathFinding**


<!--

General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.


!!! note: Math Typesetting
    Surround your math with double dollar signs to have [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) typeset it beautifully.
    To add a tilde in math mode (using dollar signs), use the `\sim` command.
    If an exponent has more than one character, you must surround it with curly braces.
    In the example below, the exponent for $T$ must use curly braces, but they aren't required for $N$.

    $$ \sim T^{1.2} N^2 $$

    Note: Typesetting like this is optional; feel free to use plain text if you'd like.


Submission
-----------

Use the CSE LogHistory Plug-in to create a zip file containing all your code, this `readme.html` document, and any additional files of evidence (ex: screenshots).
If you create a zip by other means, it will include all the files under `tests` and might miss some important files (ex: `.log/history.log`).
The former will make for a very large zip file; the latter will cause you to lose points.

Assignment Details
===================


`Pathfinding` Implementation
---------------------------

<!--
Explain briefly how you implemented the Pathfinding data type.
What did you work on first?
What did you work on next?
-->


`PFNode` Implementation
------------------------

<!--
Briefly explain how you represented the search node PFNode.
-->


`Walker` Implementation
------------------------

<!--
Explain briefly how you implemented the Walker data type.
-->



Analysis
===========


Correctness
------------

<!--
How did you test the correctness of your algorithm?
-->



Runtime Analysis
-----------------

<!--
For each of the following maps and given the default starting and ending locations, give the estimated travel
cost ($\text{cost}_0(E)$) and search size for different heuristic values ($h$).

end.cost
-->

map      | h   | cost | search

usa256   |     |      |        
usa1024  |     |      |        

<!--
Given the information above, do you notice any patterns?
Is there a value of $h$ that seems to work best?
-->


Known bugs / limitations
-------------------------

<!--
What bugs or limitations were troublesome?
What bugs or limitations still remain?
Are these bugs or limitations a problem in your implementation, algorithm, or something else?
How do you know that you did not miss a bug?
What additional tests did you run to ensure that your implementations are correct?
-->

<!-- ... -->




Reflection
===========


<!--
Did you use any of the CT Skills?
If so, which ones did you use, and how did you use them?
If not, explain what you did when you needed help.
Or, did you not need help?

- consulting an expert
- asking good questions
- edge cases
- similar problems / fewer variables
- developing subgoals
-->


<!--
What did you do to monitor your progress and make sure you did not spend more time than necessary on this assignment?
-->


<!--
Describe whatever help (if any) that you received.
Don't include readings, lectures, but do include any help from people (including course staff, lab TAs, classmates, and friends)  and attribute them by name.
-->

<!--
Since this is an individual assignment, if you worked with a partner, assert below that the work you are turning in is your own work, and that you only did "whiteboard" work as a group.
Give one sentence explaining what each of you contributed.
If you used the code from the lab challenge, explain what is shared between you and your lab partner.
-->


<!--
Describe any serious problems you encountered.
-->


<!--
List any other comments here.
Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed doing it.
